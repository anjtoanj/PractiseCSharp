// Create a new C # project with three classes plus another class to test the logic in your code. 
// The main classes of the program are the following classes:

// Person
// Student
// Professor
// The Student and Teacher classes inherit from the Person class.
// The Student class will include a public Study() method that will write I'm studying on the screen.
// The Person class must have two public methods Greet() and SetAge(int age) that will assign the age of the person.
// The Teacher class will include a public Explain() method that will write I'm explaining on the screen.
// Also create a public method ShowAge() in the Student class that writes My age is: x years old on the screen.
// You must create another test class called StudentProfessorTest with a Main method to do the following:
// Create a new Person and make him say hello
// Create a new Student, set an age, say hello, and display her age on the screen.
// Create a new Teacher, set an age, say hello and start the explanation.
 
// Output
// Hello!
// Hello!
// My age is 21 years old
// I'm studying
// Hello!
// I'm explaining
